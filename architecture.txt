Project Architecture:

The project follows a simple architecture with three main components: VotingController, VotingService, and in-memory storage for candidate data. The application is built using the Spring framework to handle RESTful API requests.

VotingController:

Receives incoming HTTP requests.
Routes requests to appropriate methods in the VotingService.
VotingService:

Implements business logic for candidate operations.
Uses local variables for in-memory storage of candidate data.
Ensures thread safety for concurrent access.
In-memory Storage:

Utilizes local variables to simulate candidate data storage.
Provides methods for adding candidates, casting votes, counting votes, listing votes, and determining the winner.
